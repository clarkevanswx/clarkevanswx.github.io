Prof. Evans will be leaving UWM for NOAA&#8217;s Global Systems Laboratory in July 2024 and thus is no longer seeking prospective graduate students to join the group.<\/p>\n<p>Even though we no longer have openings in our research group, please feel free to reach out to <a href=\"mailto:evans36-at-uwm-dot-edu\">Prof. Evans<\/a> to ask any questions you may have about applying to graduate schools in general or anything related to the field &#8211; he&#8217;d love to chat with you! Your e-mail doesn&#8217;t need to be formal: a message that introduces yourself and lets him know that you are interested in learning more is a great starting point, and we can strike up a deeper conversation from there. <\/p>\n<p>For the students with whom he works as a mentor, Prof. Evans&#8217; advising philosophy centers around treating you with respect, viewing you as a professional peer. He strives to get to know you  individually and tailors his mentoring approach to your unique needs and abilities. He strives to ensure that you will have the opportunity to present your research at one or more AMS conferences per year and to publish your research findings as lead author in leading journals. Our group&#8217;s alumni have strong track records of recognition, and all have chosen to continue their studies to the Ph.D. and\/or have found fruitful post-graduation employment across the field and beyond. Please feel free to contact <a href=\"mailto:evans36-at-uwm-dot-edu\">Prof. Evans<\/a> to learn more about his advising and mentoring philosophy. Likewise, please feel free to directly contact any of our group&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/about\/\">current members<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/alumni\/\">alumni<\/a> to inquire about their experiences in and perspectives about our group!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thank you for your interest in graduate research opportunities in our group!
