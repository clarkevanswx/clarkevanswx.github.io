Prior to joining GSL in July 2024, Dr. Evans was a Professor of <a href=\"https:\/\/uwm.edu\/atmospheric-science\/\">Atmospheric Sciences<\/a> and the Chair of the Atmospheric Sciences Program in the UWM School of Freshwater Sciences. He joined UWM&#8217;s faculty in 2011 after completing a postdoctoral fellowship with the <a href=\"https:\/\/asp.ucar.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Advanced Study Program<\/a> at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He received B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Meteorology from Florida State University in 2004, 2006, and 2009, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Clark&#8217;s research uses numerical models to better understand and predict high-impact weather phenomena, particularly tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms. He is also interested in studying how humans perceive, prepare for, and respond to threats from these phenomena. He has published twenty-seven papers in the peer-reviewed literature, many with the graduate and undergraduate students with whom he has worked as lead author, and he has served as PI or co-PI on eighteen funded awards totaling $5.5 million. He was a 2021 recipient of the UWM Office of Research\/UWM Foundation Faculty Research Award. More details are available in his <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/files\/2025\/04\/CurriculumVita.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Curriculum Vita<\/a> (updated April 2025).<\/p>\n<p>Clark is passionate about service in the profession and in the community. Currently, Clark serves as the Commissioner of the American Meteorological Society\u2019s Scientific and Technological Activities Commission, an Editor for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ametsoc.org\/ams\/index.cfm\/publications\/journals\/monthly-weather-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Monthly Weather Review<\/i><\/a>, and a member of the Developmental Testbed Center\u2019s Science Advisory Board. Between May 2023 and April 2024, he also served as a Trustee of the <a href=\"https:\/\/village.grafton.wi.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Village of Grafton, WI<\/a> (pop. ~12,000). He was a 2021 recipient of the UWM Distinguished Faculty University Service Award and a 2023 recipient of the UWM Distinguished Faculty Public Service Award.<\/p>\n<p>On a personal level, Clark is interested in his faith, running, cycling, sports, hiking, photography, cartography, historical accounts, and traveling. Far too many of his conversations revolve around the weather, even when he&#8217;s actively trying to keep it from happening. He loves parks and trails and is a big fan of being outside, particularly when the sky is blue, the fields are green, and the air is warm. You&#8217;ll find him gleeful about the first warm days of spring and counting down the days to the return of daylight-saving time in winter. He lives along the Colorado Front Range with his wife and son.
