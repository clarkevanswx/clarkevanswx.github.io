Our research interests in these areas are fairly broad, with current emphases including tropical-midlatitude flow interactions, tropical storm intensity change over land, and mesoscale convective system structural morphology.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-left\" src=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/files\/2019\/06\/indirectc-1.jpg\"\/ ><strong>Tropical Cyclone-Midlatitude Flow Interactions<\/strong><br \/>\nThe interaction of a tropical cyclone with the antecedent midlatitude pattern can reconfigure the downstream flow over one or more synoptic-scale wavelengths, at times resulting in distinct high-impact weather events well removed from the tropical cyclone. This interaction is primarily diabatically driven with contributions from both cyclone- and thunderstorm-scale latent heating and associated circulations. With seed funding from UWM, we are using high-resolution CMIP6 climate-model outputs to evaluate how tropical cyclone-midlatitude flow interactions and subsequent downstream development will differ in a future climate.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-left\" src=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/files\/2019\/06\/inlandtc.png\" \/><strong>Overland Tropical Cyclone Intensity Change<\/strong><br \/>\nTropical cyclones are primarily fueled by energy extracted from an underlying warm ocean. Although most tropical cyclones weaken after making landfall due to relatively high friction and a reduced ability to extract energy from the underlying surface over land, some tropical cyclones have reintensified over land. However, the precise physical processes at the land-atmosphere interface and in the upper soil that permit overland reintensification to occur are not yet agreed upon. With funding from NSF, we are using idealized and real-data numerical simulations to better understand these physical processes and quantify their predictability. We are also using reanalysis data to refine the climatology of these events.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-left\" src=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/files\/2019\/05\/Research.png\" \/><strong>Mesoscale Convective Systems<\/strong><br \/>\nMesoscale convective systems are important contributors to the warm-season precipitation climatology of the central and eastern United States. We are particularly interested in the structure and evolution of mesoscale convective systems&#8217; rear-inflow jets, which typically form as a mesoscale convective system initially becomes tilted against the direction of the environmental vertical wind shear. With funding from the Dept. of Energy, we are using radar-derived observations and large-eddy-scale real-data numerical simulations to quantify the contributions of low-frequency gravity waves, line-end vortices, and the environmental flow to this rear inflow for mesoscale convective systems during MC3E and PECAN.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-left\" src=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/files\/2019\/05\/ci3.png\" \/><strong>Other Research Emphases<\/strong><br \/>\nOur group is also involved in a wide array of research projects that don&#8217;t fit neatly into one of our three emphases! We&#8217;re currently collecting observations to assess how the warm-season atmospheric boundary layer over Lake Michigan is structured, how that structure varies as a function of synoptic conditions, and how well high-resolution numerical weather prediction models are able to depict and forecast this structure. We&#8217;re also studying how meteorological seasons are defined from both physical and societal perspectives, with an eye toward assessing the overlap between severe-weather and hurricane seasons in the southeast United States and this overlap&#8217;s impacts to society.<\/p>\n<p>For a full publication listing with accessible summaries, please see the <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.uwm.edu\/evans36\/publications\/\">Publications<\/a> page.
