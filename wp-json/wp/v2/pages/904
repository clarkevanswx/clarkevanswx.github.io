Yet, common meteorological features such fronts and processes such as turbulent vertical mixing can lead to similarly shaped vertical profiles despite these differences. This study presents a novel method for accounting for the location, time-of-day, and seasonal differences between soundings, in which the temperature and dewpoint profiles are recast relative to a new horizontal coordinate. Objective classification methods applied to the recast dataset retain greater fidelity in temperature and dewpoint profile shapes than when applied to the original data.
